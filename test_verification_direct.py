According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1¬∞C since pre-industrial times.\n\n## Key Claims\n1. **Temperature Rise**: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies reports that 2023 was the warmest year on record globally.\n2. **Sea Level Rise**: Sea levels have risen by approximately 8-9 inches since 1880.\n3. **Economic Impact**: The transition to renewable energy could create millions of jobs globally.\n\n## Sources\nThis document references IPCC reports, NASA data, and NOAA measurements.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(f\"üìÑ Test Document Length: {len(test_content)} characters\")\nprint(\"\\nTest completed - basic imports successful!\")

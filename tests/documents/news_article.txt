Breaking: Major Climate Summit Reaches Historic Agreement

GLASGOW - World leaders at COP26 have reached a groundbreaking agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, marking the most significant climate deal since the Paris Agreement.

The agreement, signed by 196 countries, includes commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The deal also establishes a $100 billion annual fund to help developing nations transition to clean energy.

"This is a historic moment for humanity," said UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres. "We have finally taken the decisive steps needed to address the climate crisis."

The agreement comes after two weeks of intense negotiations, with several countries initially opposing key provisions. The breakthrough occurred when China and India agreed to phase down coal use, marking a significant shift in their energy policies.

Environmental groups have praised the agreement while noting that implementation will be crucial. "The real work starts now," said Greenpeace International Director Jennifer Morgan. "Governments must follow through on these commitments with concrete action."

The agreement faces several challenges, including verification mechanisms and enforcement protocols. Critics argue that the timelines may be too ambitious for some developing nations without adequate financial support.

Financial markets responded positively to the news, with renewable energy stocks climbing 5% in early trading. The agreement is expected to accelerate investment in clean technology and sustainable infrastructure worldwide.

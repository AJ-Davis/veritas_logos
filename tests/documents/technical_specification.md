# Distributed Verification System Architecture Specification

## Version 1.2.0
## Document Type: Technical Specification

## 1. System Overview

The Distributed Verification System (DVS) implements a multi-node architecture for document verification using blockchain-based consensus mechanisms. The system processes up to 10,000 documents per minute with 99.9% uptime guarantee.

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1 Core Services
- **Verification Engine**: Processes documents using ML models trained on 50 million samples
- **Consensus Layer**: Implements Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) algorithm
- **Storage Layer**: Distributed IPFS-based content addressing system
- **API Gateway**: Rate-limited REST and GraphQL endpoints

### 2.2 Performance Requirements
- Maximum latency: 500ms for document verification
- Throughput: 10,000 requests/minute sustained
- Storage capacity: 10 petabytes with automatic scaling
- Network bandwidth: 100 Gbps aggregate capacity

## 3. Verification Algorithm

### 3.1 Multi-Stage Pipeline
1. **Document Parsing**: Extract text, metadata, and structure
2. **Claim Extraction**: Identify factual statements using NLP models
3. **Source Verification**: Cross-reference against authoritative databases
4. **Consensus Generation**: Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement protocol

### 3.2 Accuracy Metrics
- Precision: 94.7% on benchmark datasets
- Recall: 91.2% for factual claim detection
- F1-Score: 92.9% across all document types
- False positive rate: <0.5% for high-confidence assertions

## 4. Security Specifications

### 4.1 Cryptographic Standards
- Encryption: AES-256-GCM for data at rest
- Transport: TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy
- Signing: ECDSA with P-256 curve for document integrity
- Hashing: SHA-3 for content addressing

### 4.2 Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication required for all operations
- Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- Zero-trust network architecture implementation
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## 5. API Specifications

### 5.1 Verification Endpoint
```
POST /api/v1/verify
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "document_id": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "verification_level": "standard|enhanced|comprehensive"
}
```

### 5.2 Response Format
```json
{
  "verification_id": "uuid",
  "status": "verified|disputed|unknown",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "claims": [...],
  "sources": [...],
  "consensus_score": 0.87
}
```

## 6. Deployment Requirements

### 6.1 Infrastructure
- Minimum 5 nodes for Byzantine fault tolerance

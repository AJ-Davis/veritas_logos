# Description: Create the output generation system that produces annotated documents, dashboard data, and JSON API responses.
# Details:
Use `python-docx` and `reportlab` to generate annotated PDF/DOCX outputs with issue highlights and comments. Create JSON structures for API responses. Design data structures for dashboard visualization. Implement the Debate View that shows Challenger critiques, Defender rebuttals, and Judge rulings.

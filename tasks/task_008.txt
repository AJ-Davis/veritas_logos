# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Actionable Outputs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the output generation system that produces annotated documents, dashboard data, and JSON API responses.
# Details:
Use `python-docx` and `reportlab` to generate annotated PDF/DOCX outputs with issue highlights and comments. Create JSON structures for API responses. Design data structures for dashboard visualization. Implement the Debate View that shows Challenger critiques, Defender rebuttals, and Judge rulings.

# Test Strategy:
Test output generation with various document types and verification results. Verify that annotations correctly highlight issues in the original document. Test the structure and completeness of API responses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Output Data Structures [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the foundational data structures that will be used across all output formats (documents, API, dashboard).
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `VerificationResult` class that encapsulates all verification outputs including issues, scores, and metadata
2. Design an `Issue` class with properties for type, severity, location, description, and remediation suggestions
3. Implement a `DebateEntry` class to represent Challenger critiques, Defender rebuttals, and Judge rulings
4. Create a `DocumentAnnotation` class to store document-specific annotations (highlights, comments, references)
5. Design serialization methods for all classes to convert to/from JSON
6. Write unit tests for each data structure

Testing approach: Create test fixtures with sample verification results and validate serialization/deserialization works correctly.

## Initial Exploration Results

I've analyzed the existing codebase to understand the current data structures available for building the output system. Here are the key findings:

### Existing Data Structures Found:
1. **VerificationResult** (src/models/verification.py) - Already exists and handles single pass results
2. **VerificationChainResult** (src/models/verification.py) - Already exists for complete chain results  
3. **UnifiedIssue & IssueRegistry** (src/models/issues.py) - Comprehensive issue representation system already implemented
4. **DebateRound & ACVFResult** (src/models/acvf.py) - Complete ACVF debate system already in place
5. **ParsedDocument** (src/models/document.py) - Document representation with sections and metadata

### What Still Needs to Be Created:
1. **DocumentAnnotation** class - for storing document-specific annotations (highlights, comments, references)
2. **OutputVerificationResult** wrapper - a specialized wrapper around existing VerificationChainResult for output generation
3. **AnnotationStyle** configuration classes - for styling highlights and comments based on issue severity
4. **OutputContext** class - for managing the overall output generation context and settings

### Implementation Plan:
I will create a new `src/models/output.py` file that defines the output-specific data structures while leveraging the existing robust models. This approach will:
- Reuse the excellent existing VerificationResult and Issue systems
- Add annotation-specific functionality on top
- Provide output format flexibility
- Maintain consistency with the rest of the codebase

## 2. Implement Document Annotation Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create the core engine for annotating documents with issue highlights, comments, and references.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create an `AnnotationEngine` class that takes a `VerificationResult` and original document
2. Implement text location mapping between original document and verification results
3. Create highlight generation functions with configurable styles based on issue severity
4. Implement comment insertion logic for attaching issue details to specific document locations
5. Add reference linking between related issues in the document
6. Create utility functions to convert between document coordinate systems

Testing approach: Create test documents with known issues and verify the annotation engine correctly identifies locations and applies appropriate annotations.

## 3. Build PDF/DOCX Output Generators [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Implement document generators that produce annotated PDF and DOCX files using the annotation engine.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `DocxGenerator` class using python-docx that applies annotations to DOCX documents
2. Implement a `PdfGenerator` class using reportlab that creates annotated PDF outputs
3. Add configuration options for styling (colors, fonts, highlight styles)
4. Implement a summary section generator that provides an overview of all issues
5. Create a table of contents for easy navigation of issues by category
6. Add document metadata (generation date, verification parameters, etc.)

Testing approach: Generate annotated documents from test fixtures and manually verify the output. Create automated tests that check for the presence of expected elements in the generated files.

- **Rendering Queue**: Implement a priority-based rendering queue to handle overlapping annotations efficiently

### PDF Generator Technical Details
```python
class PdfGenerator(BaseDocumentGenerator):
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.styles = getSampleStyleSheet()
        self.custom_styles = self._initialize_custom_styles()
        self.bookmark_tree = []  # For TOC generation
        
    def _initialize_custom_styles(self):
        # Create custom paragraph styles with specific fonts and colors
        custom = {}
        custom['Critical'] = ParagraphStyle(
            'Critical',
            parent=self.styles['Normal'],
            textColor=colors.red,
            backColor=colors.lightgrey,
            borderWidth=1,
            borderColor=colors.red,
            borderPadding=5
        )
        # Additional styles for other severity levels...
        return custom
        
    def _handle_overlapping_annotations(self, annotations):
        # Algorithm to resolve overlapping text regions
        # Returns a flattened list of non-overlapping annotation segments
        # with appropriate styling information
```

### DOCX Generator Implementation Notes
- Use `python-docx`'s `Document.add_paragraph().add_run()` method with styling for fine-grained control
- Implement custom XML manipulation for advanced features not supported by the library:
```python
def _add_comment_reference(self, paragraph, comment_text, author="AI Verification"):
    """Add Word comment to specific text using direct XML manipulation"""
    # Get the paragraph's XML element
    p = paragraph._element
    
    # Create a unique comment ID
    comment_id = str(self._next_comment_id())
    
    # Create comment reference mark in the paragraph
    comment_reference = OxmlElement('w:commentReference')
    comment_reference.set(qn('w:id'), comment_id)
    p.append(comment_reference)
    
    # Add the actual comment to the comments part
    self._add_comment_to_part(comment_id, comment_text, author)
```

    """Groups arguments into conversation threads based on references"""
    
    # Initialize thread structure
    threads = {}
    root_arguments = []
    
    # First pass: identify all arguments and create thread entries
    for arg in arguments:
        if not arg.references or not arg.references[0].argument_id:
            # This is a root argument (not referencing another argument)
            root_arguments.append(arg)
            threads[arg.id] = {
                'argument': arg,
                'children': []
            }
        else:
            # This references another argument
            parent_id = arg.references[0].argument_id
            if parent_id not in threads:
                # Create placeholder if parent not yet processed
                threads[parent_id] = {
                    'argument': None,
                    'children': []
                }
            threads[parent_id]['children'].append(arg)
            
            # Ensure this argument has an entry too
            if arg.id not in threads:
                threads[arg.id] = {
                    'argument': arg,
                    'children': []
                }
    
    # Build the threaded structure recursively
    threaded_arguments = []
    for root_arg in root_arguments:
        threaded_arguments.extend(
            self._build_thread(root_arg, threads, 0)
        )
    
    return threaded_arguments
```

## Evidence Linking Implementation

```python
def _process_evidence_links(self, argument, document):
    """Processes and formats evidence links between arguments and document"""
    if not document or not argument.content:
        return []
    
    # Extract potential references from argument content
    references = self._linker.find_references(argument.content, document)
    
    # Format each reference with context
    evidence_links = []
    for ref in references:
        section = document.get_section(ref.section_id)
        if section:
            context = section.get_context_around(ref.span, window_size=100)
            link = self._linker.create_document_link(
                section_id=ref.section_id,
                reference_text=ref.text,
                context=context
            )
            evidence_links.append(link)
    
    return evidence_links
```

## Performance Optimizations

```python
class LazyFormatter:
    """Handles lazy formatting of debate content to improve performance"""
    
    def __init__(self, formatter):
        self.formatter = formatter
        self._cache = {}
    
    def format_content(self, entry_id, content, participant_type):
        """Lazily formats content only when needed"""
        cache_key = f"{entry_id}:{participant_type}"
        
        if cache_key not in self._cache:
            formatted = self.formatter.format_argument_content(
                content, participant_type
            )
            self._cache[cache_key] = formatted
            
        return self._cache[cache_key]
```

These implementation details provide a comprehensive foundation for the Debate View Output Generator, focusing on the technical architecture, styling system, document linking, and performance considerations.

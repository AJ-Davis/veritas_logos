Design an `Issue` class with properties for type, severity, location, description, and remediation suggestions\n3. Implement a `DebateEntry` class to represent Challenger critiques, Defender rebuttals, and Judge rulings\n4. Create a `DocumentAnnotation` class to store document-specific annotations (highlights, comments, references)\n5. Design serialization methods for all classes to convert to/from JSON\n6. Write unit tests for each data structure\n\nTesting approach: Create test fixtures with sample verification results and validate serialization/deserialization works correctly.\n\n<info added on 2025-06-09T19:31:23.151Z>\n## Initial Exploration Results\n\nI've analyzed the existing codebase to understand the current data structures available for building the output system. Here are the key findings:\n\n### Existing Data Structures Found:\n1. **VerificationResult** (src/models/verification.py) - Already exists and handles single pass results\n2. **VerificationChainResult** (src/models/verification.py) - Already exists for complete chain results  \n3. **UnifiedIssue & IssueRegistry** (src/models/issues.py) - Comprehensive issue representation system already implemented\n4. **DebateRound & ACVFResult** (src/models/acvf.py) - Complete ACVF debate system already in place\n5. **ParsedDocument** (src/models/document.py) - Document representation with sections and metadata\n\n### What Still Needs to Be Created:\n1. **DocumentAnnotation** class - for storing document-specific annotations (highlights, comments, references)\n2. **OutputVerificationResult** wrapper - a specialized wrapper around existing VerificationChainResult for output generation\n3. **AnnotationStyle** configuration classes - for styling highlights and comments based on issue severity\n4. **OutputContext** class - for managing the overall output generation context and settings\n\n### Implementation Plan:\nI will create a new `src/models/output.py` file that defines the output-specific data structures while leveraging the existing robust models. This approach will:\n- Reuse the excellent existing VerificationResult and Issue systems\n- Add annotation-specific functionality on top\n- Provide output format flexibility\n- Maintain consistency with the rest of the codebase\n</info added on 2025-06-09T19:31:23.151Z>",

The fix is to convert all relative imports to absolute imports using \"src\" as the package root.\n\n**Fix Strategy:**\nConvert all patterns like:\n- \"from ..models.acvf import ACVFRole\" → \"from src.models.acvf import ACVFRole\"  \n- \"from ...models.verification import\" → \"from src.models.verification import\"\n\nGenerated detailed report saved to import_analysis_report.txt with specific file locations and line numbers for all problematic imports.\n</info added on 2025-06-10T16:27:02.750Z>",

Key accomplishments:\n\n- Identified and fixed a critical syntax error in llm_client.py where an import statement was incorrectly placed inside a function definition\n- Implemented consistent import pattern using `src.module.submodule` format across all 32 affected files\n- Resolved circular import issues by restructuring import statements in the verification pass modules\n- Added proper `__init__.py` files in several directories to ensure package resolution works correctly\n\n**Technical Implementation Notes:**\n- Used `importlib.util.find_spec()` to verify import path resolution during conversion\n- Applied import grouping pattern: standard library → third-party → local absolute imports\n- Implemented deferred imports in 3 cases where circular dependencies couldn't be resolved through restructuring\n- Added explicit type annotations with `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional imports where needed\n- Created import aliases in cases where name conflicts occurred\n\n**Validation Testing:**\n- All unit tests now pass with the new import structure\n- Verified imports work correctly in both development and packaged environments\n- Confirmed compatibility with both Python 3.9 and 3.10\n</info added on 2025-06-10T16:35:47.417Z>",

Analyze the nature of the dependency\n   b. Determine if it can be resolved by restructuring the code\n   c. Consider using design patterns like dependency injection\n   d. Implement the appropriate solution (moving code, using import inside functions, etc.)\n3. Pay special attention to imports between core modules\n4. Document any significant architectural changes made to resolve circular dependencies\n5. Update the dependency graph to reflect the new structure\n\nTesting approach:\n- Test each modified module to ensure it imports correctly\n- Verify that circular dependencies are properly resolved\n- Run comprehensive tests to ensure functionality is preserved\n- Check for any new import errors that might have been introduced\n\n<info added on 2025-06-10T17:35:39.275Z>\n**Circular Dependency Resolution Techniques:**\n\nWhen resolving circular dependencies, consider these implementation approaches:\n\n1. **Interface Segregation**: \n   - Extract shared interfaces into separate modules\n   - Example: Move `ClaimInterface` to a dedicated `interfaces.py` file that both dependent modules can import\n\n2. **Dependency Inversion**:\n   ```python\n   # Before (circular):\n   # module_a.py imports module_b.py which imports module_a.py\n   \n   # After (resolved):\n   # shared_interfaces.py\n   class ServiceInterface(Protocol):\n       def process(self, data: Any) -> Result: ...\n   \n   # module_a.py\n   from shared_interfaces import ServiceInterface\n   \n   # module_b.py\n   from shared_interfaces import ServiceInterface\n   ```\n\n3. **Lazy Loading Pattern**:\n   ```python\n   # Instead of top-level imports:\n   def get_processor():\n       from .processor import Processor  # Import inside function\n       return Processor()\n   ```\n\n4. **Common Anti-patterns to Watch For**:\n   - Bidirectional parent-child relationships\n   - Utility modules importing from business logic\n   - Configuration modules with business logic dependencies\n\n5. **Validation Tool**: Consider implementing a simple import validator:\n   ```python\n   import importlib\n   import sys\n   \n   def validate_imports(module_path):\n       \"\"\"Test-import a module and report any circular dependency errors\"\"\"\n       try:\n           importlib.import_module(module_path)\n           return True\n       except ImportError as e:\n           if \"circular import\" in str(e).lower():\n               print(f\"Circular import in {module_path}: {e}\")\n               return False\n           raise\n   ```\n</info added on 2025-06-10T17:35:39.275Z>",

# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Logic Analysis and Bias Scan Modules
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement verification passes for logical fallacy detection and bias identification.
# Details:
Create Python modules for logic analysis that identifies logical fallacies, invalid inferences, and reasoning errors. Implement bias scanning to detect potential bias in document content. Design Pydantic schemas for logic and bias verification results. Integrate with both the standard verification chain and the ACVF system.

# Test Strategy:
Test with documents containing known logical fallacies and biases. Create benchmark suite for measuring detection accuracy. Test integration with ACVF to ensure logical issues are properly debated.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Pydantic Schemas for Logic and Bias Verification Results [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create standardized Pydantic data models to represent the outputs of logic analysis and bias scanning modules. These schemas will ensure consistent data structures throughout the verification system.
### Details:
Implement the following schemas:
1. Create a base `VerificationResult` schema with common fields like confidence score, severity level, and location information
2. Extend with `LogicalFallacyResult` schema including fallacy type, description, and reasoning pattern identified
3. Implement `BiasDetectionResult` schema with bias type, affected groups, and potential impact metrics
4. Add helper methods for result aggregation and severity classification
5. Include JSON serialization/deserialization support
6. Add documentation with examples for each schema

Testing approach: Write unit tests to validate schema validation, serialization/deserialization, and edge cases with unusual inputs.

Based on the completed implementation, here are additional technical insights for future reference:

1. **Schema Extension Points**: The current schemas support extension through inheritance. Consider adding abstract base classes for custom verification types that follow the same pattern.

2. **Performance Optimization**: For large documents, the result objects may become memory-intensive. Consider implementing lazy loading or pagination mechanisms for the results collections.

3. **Integration Notes**:
   - When consuming these models in the API layer, use Pydantic's `.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)` for efficient JSON serialization
   - The enums (LogicalFallacyType, BiasType) can be extended without breaking existing code

4. **Advanced Usage**:
   ```python
   # Example for filtering high-severity issues
   def get_critical_issues(result: LogicAnalysisResult) -> list[LogicalIssue]:
       return [issue for issue in result.issues if issue.severity >= 0.7]
   
   # Example for categorizing issues by type
   def group_by_fallacy_type(result: LogicAnalysisResult) -> dict[LogicalFallacyType, list[LogicalIssue]]:
       grouped = defaultdict(list)
       for issue in result.issues:
           grouped[issue.fallacy_type].append(issue)
       return dict(grouped)
   ```

5. **Schema Validation**: The models include custom validators that ensure consistency between related fields (e.g., severity and impact metrics).

## 2. Implement Core Logic Analysis Module with Rule-Based Fallacy Detection [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop the foundation of the logic analysis module using rule-based approaches to identify common logical fallacies and reasoning errors in text.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a modular `LogicAnalyzer` class using the Strategy pattern to support multiple detection approaches
2. Implement rule-based detectors for common fallacies (ad hominem, straw man, false dichotomy, etc.) using spaCy for NLP processing
3. Develop pattern matching for syllogistic errors and invalid inferences
4. Create a registry system for fallacy types with descriptions and examples
5. Implement confidence scoring based on pattern strength and context
6. Return results using the Pydantic schemas defined in subtask 1
7. Add configuration options for sensitivity and fallacy types to check

Testing approach: Create a test suite with examples of each fallacy type, both clear and ambiguous cases. Measure precision and recall against a manually labeled dataset.

<info added on 2025-06-05T20:44:01.918Z>
Additional implementation details:

The existing LogicAnalysisPass implementation uses a hybrid approach with LLMs rather than purely rule-based detection. To enhance this:

1. Consider adding a fallback rule-based system for when LLM services are unavailable or for low-latency requirements:
   - Implement regex patterns and linguistic markers for common fallacies
   - Use dependency parsing in spaCy to identify argument structure
   - Create heuristic rules for detecting contradiction patterns

2. Improve confidence scoring by:
   - Implementing a calibration layer that adjusts LLM confidence scores based on historical accuracy
   - Adding a verification step that cross-checks results between rule-based and LLM approaches
   - Storing detection patterns that consistently yield high-precision results

3. Enhance the fallacy registry with:
   - Severity classification (critical, major, minor)
   - Domain-specific fallacy patterns (scientific, political, commercial)
   - Counter-argument templates for each fallacy type

4. Consider performance optimizations:
   - Implement caching for similar text patterns
   - Add batching support for processing multiple text segments
   - Create a lightweight pre-filter to identify passages likely to contain fallacies

## 3. Develop Bias Scanning Module with Statistical and Lexical Analysis [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a bias detection module that combines statistical analysis and lexical scanning to identify potential biases in document content.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `BiasScannerModule` class with pluggable detection strategies
2. Implement lexical bias detection using curated word lists for different bias categories (gender, racial, age, etc.)
3. Add context-aware analysis to distinguish between mentions and endorsements of biased viewpoints
4. Implement statistical bias detection for quantitative claims and representation analysis
5. Create visualization helpers for bias distribution in documents
6. Add configuration for sensitivity thresholds and bias categories to scan
7. Return results using the Pydantic schemas from subtask 1
8. Implement bias severity scoring based on frequency, explicitness, and impact

Testing approach: Test with diverse document samples containing known biases. Include edge cases like discussions about bias that aren't themselves biased. Validate with human reviewers for a subset of results.

<info added on 2025-06-05T20:44:20.131Z>
The existing implementation in `src/verification/passes/implementations/bias_scan_pass.py` already covers the core requirements, but we can enhance it with these specific improvements:

1. **Performance optimization**: Implement caching for previously analyzed text segments to reduce redundant LLM calls, using a TTL-based cache with configurable expiration.

2. **Enhanced lexical analysis**:
   - Add support for domain-specific bias dictionaries that can be loaded at runtime
   - Implement n-gram analysis (not just single words) to catch phrases with implicit bias

3. **Statistical enhancement**:
   - Add quantitative representation metrics (e.g., calculating proportional representation of different groups)
   - Implement comparative baseline analysis against reference corpora

4. **Integration points**:
   - Add hooks for custom bias detection plugins
   - Create an API endpoint for standalone bias analysis

5. **Evaluation framework**:
   - Implement confusion matrix tracking for bias detection accuracy
   - Add support for human-in-the-loop feedback to improve detection quality

6. **Documentation**:
   - Create usage examples for different content types
   - Document configuration parameters and their effects on sensitivity/specificity

## 4. Enhance Logic and Bias Modules with ML-Based Detection [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Extend the rule-based modules with machine learning approaches to improve detection accuracy and handle more subtle cases of logical fallacies and bias.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Integrate Hugging Face transformers for contextual understanding of text
2. Implement a fine-tuned classifier for logical fallacy detection using pre-labeled examples
3. Create an ensemble approach that combines rule-based and ML-based detection
4. Add fairness metrics from Fairlearn to enhance bias detection capabilities
5. Implement confidence calibration for ML predictions
6. Create a feedback loop mechanism to improve models based on verification results
7. Optimize for performance with batching and caching strategies
8. Add explainability features to highlight why text was flagged

Testing approach: Compare performance against rule-based approaches alone. Use cross-validation and confusion matrices to evaluate ML model performance. Test with adversarial examples designed to evade detection.

# Implementation Status Update

## Current Implementation Status
- `ml_enhanced_logic.py` (593 lines) contains `MLEnhancedLogicAnalyzer` with ensemble methods, rule-based patterns, and transformer models
- `ml_enhanced_bias.py` (796 lines) contains `MLEnhancedBiasAnalyzer` with lexical analysis, statistical bias detection, and fairness metrics
- Modules are implemented but not integrated into the main verification system

## Integration Tasks
1. Update `__init__.py` to export ML-enhanced classes:
   ```python
   from .ml_enhanced_logic import MLEnhancedLogicAnalyzer
   from .ml_enhanced_bias import MLEnhancedBiasAnalyzer
   
   __all__ = ['BasicLogicAnalyzer', 'BasicBiasAnalyzer', 
              'MLEnhancedLogicAnalyzer', 'MLEnhancedBiasAnalyzer']
   ```

2. Create configuration options in `config.py`:
   ```python
   ANALYZER_CONFIG = {
       "logic_analyzer": {
           "type": "ml_enhanced",  # Options: "basic", "ml_enhanced"
           "confidence_threshold": 0.75,
           "use_ensemble": True
       },
       "bias_analyzer": {
           "type": "ml_enhanced",  # Options: "basic", "ml_enhanced"
           "fairness_metrics": ["demographic_parity", "equal_opportunity"],
           "sensitivity": "medium"  # Options: "low", "medium", "high"
       }
   }
   ```

3. Update factory methods in `verification_chain.py` to use configuration:
   ```python
   def get_logic_analyzer(config):
       if config["logic_analyzer"]["type"] == "ml_enhanced":
           return MLEnhancedLogicAnalyzer(
               confidence_threshold=config["logic_analyzer"]["confidence_threshold"],
               use_ensemble=config["logic_analyzer"]["use_ensemble"]
           )
       return BasicLogicAnalyzer()
   ```

4. Performance benchmarking code needed in `benchmarks/ml_comparison.py` to measure:
   - Accuracy improvements
   - Processing time differences
   - Memory usage
   - False positive/negative rates

# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Logic Analysis and Bias Scan Modules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement verification passes for logical fallacy detection and bias identification.
# Details:
Create Python modules for logic analysis that identifies logical fallacies, invalid inferences, and reasoning errors. Implement bias scanning to detect potential bias in document content. Design Pydantic schemas for logic and bias verification results. Integrate with both the standard verification chain and the ACVF system.

# Test Strategy:
Test with documents containing known logical fallacies and biases. Create benchmark suite for measuring detection accuracy. Test integration with ACVF to ensure logical issues are properly debated.

# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Basic Verification Chain Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core orchestration system for sequential verification passes (claim extraction, evidence retrieval, citation check, logic analysis, bias scan).
# Details:
Build a FastAPI + Celery based task orchestration system. Create YAML configuration for chain definitions. Implement async processing with retry mechanisms. Design the core verification worker that will execute each pass in the chain. Create interfaces for the different verification passes that will be implemented in subsequent tasks.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for chain configuration parsing. Integration tests with mock LLM responses to verify the full chain execution. Test retry mechanisms with simulated failures.

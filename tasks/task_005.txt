# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Adversarial Cross-Validation Framework (ACVF)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core ACVF system that pits Challenger models against Defender models with Judge adjudication.
# Details:
Create the ACVF controller in Python that: 1) pairs models as Challengers and Defenders, 2) tracks debate rounds, and 3) triggers Judge models. Implement the `adversarial_chains.yml` configuration. Design Pydantic schemas for `DebateRound` and `JudgeVerdict`. Add role parameters to LLM adapters (Challenger/Defender/Judge). Create database tables for `debate_rounds` and `judge_scores`.

Implementation Complete:
- ✅ ACVF controller with debate orchestration (539 lines)
- ✅ Pydantic schemas for DebateRound, JudgeVerdict, and all ACVF models
- ✅ LLM client with Challenger/Defender/Judge role parameters
- ✅ adversarial_chains.yml configuration system (145 lines)
- ✅ Multi-round debate logic with consensus scoring
- ✅ Model validation and conflict prevention
- ✅ Escalation and trigger condition handling
- ✅ Database persistence layer with SQLAlchemy models
  - debate_rounds, judge_scores, debate_arguments, model_assignments, acvf_sessions tables
  - Repository pattern implementation in src/verification/acvf_repository.py
  - Controller integration with database persistence
  - Support for SQLite and PostgreSQL environments
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

Final Implementation Fixes:
- ✅ Fixed all relative imports to use absolute paths across the ACVF system components
- ✅ Resolved all Pydantic validation errors (added missing required fields, fixed enum values)
- ✅ Fixed SQLAlchemy conflicts by renaming metadata columns to avoid reserved attribute conflicts
- ✅ Updated test data structures to match expected formats
- ✅ All 13 ACVF tests now passing

Validated ACVF System Features:
- ✅ Model assignments and role configurations
- ✅ Debate argument creation and management
- ✅ Judge score generation with confidence levels
- ✅ Debate round validation and status tracking
- ✅ Configuration loading and validation
- ✅ ACVF trigger conditions and escalation logic
- ✅ End-to-end verification escalation workflow
- ✅ Database persistence and integration
- ✅ Multi-round debate consensus algorithms

# Test Strategy:
Test with predefined scenarios of claims and citations. Verify that the debate flow works correctly through multiple rounds. Test Judge adjudication with various Challenger and Defender inputs. Validate database persistence by ensuring all debate data is properly stored and retrievable. Test database operations with both SQLite and PostgreSQL environments. Verify that the repository pattern correctly bridges Pydantic business models with SQLAlchemy persistence.

All 13 ACVF tests are now passing, validating:
- Import path correctness across all ACVF components
- Pydantic model validation with all required fields
- SQLAlchemy integration without column conflicts
- Proper test data structures matching expected formats
- End-to-end verification workflows with escalation logic

# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Issue Detection and Flagging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the system that aggregates verification results and flags issues with appropriate metadata.
# Details:
Building on the existing foundation (ResultAggregator, individual issue models, ACVF escalation system, and pass-specific flagging), complete the issue detection and flagging system with the following components:

1. Create a unified Issue model that can represent issues from all verification passes with standardized metadata, severity scoring, and confidence aggregation

2. Implement an IssueDetectionEngine that collects issues from all verification passes, applies unified scoring, deduplicates similar issues, and prioritizes based on impact and confidence

3. Enhance the existing ACVF escalation system with smarter routing logic for different issue types, tracking of escalation history, and prevention of infinite loops

4. Develop an Issue metadata system that tracks cross-pass correlations, verification result lineage, ACVF debate history, and confidence evolution

5. Implement advanced prioritization algorithms including document-level impact assessment, issue clustering, root cause analysis, and dynamic priority adjustment

# Test Strategy:
Test with various verification scenarios to ensure proper flagging. Verify that high-confidence issues are properly prioritized. Test ACVF escalation triggers and results. Add comprehensive tests for:
- Cross-pass issue aggregation and deduplication
- Unified Issue model serialization and deserialization
- Issue prioritization algorithms with different document contexts
- Escalation routing logic for different issue types
- End-to-end issue detection workflow with multiple verification passes

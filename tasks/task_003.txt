# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Claim Extraction Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the first verification pass that extracts claims from documents for subsequent verification.
# Details:
Create a Python module that uses LLM APIs to identify and extract claims from parsed documents. Design a Pydantic schema for representing claims with metadata (location in document, confidence, etc.). Implement prompt engineering for optimal claim extraction. Integrate with the verification chain framework.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with predefined documents containing known claims. Measure extraction accuracy against human-labeled test data. Test with different document types and structures.

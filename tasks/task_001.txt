# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Multi-Format Document Ingestion
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Python-centric document ingestion system that accepts PDF, DOCX, Markdown, and TXT files up to 150 MB or 1M tokens.
# Details:
Create a unified document parser using `pdfplumber`, `pytesseract`, `python-docx`, and `markdown-it-py`. Design a common dataclass structure to represent parsed documents regardless of source format. Implement file size validation and token counting. Create a clean API for the ingestion service that will be called by the FastAPI gateway.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each parser with sample files of each format. Integration tests with oversized files, corrupted files, and edge cases like scanned PDFs. Benchmark parsing speed and memory usage.

# Climate Change and Renewable Energy: A Brief Analysis

## Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1Â°C since pre-industrial times.

## Key Claims

### Temperature Trends
The planet has experienced unprecedented warming in recent decades. NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies reports that 2023 was the warmest year on record globally.

### Renewable Energy Growth
Solar energy capacity has grown exponentially, with costs falling by over 80% in the last decade according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Wind power has also seen significant cost reductions of approximately 70% during the same period.

### Ocean Impacts
Sea levels have risen by approximately 8-9 inches since 1880, primarily due to thermal expansion and melting ice sheets. The rate of sea level rise has accelerated to 3.3 mm per year since 1993.

### Economic Considerations
The transition to renewable energy could create millions of jobs globally. Some estimates suggest that renewable energy employment could reach 42 million jobs by 2050.

## Conclusion

Addressing climate change through renewable energy adoption is both an environmental necessity and an economic opportunity. However, the transition requires coordinated global action and significant investment.

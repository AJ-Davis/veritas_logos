    Climate Change and Renewable Energy: A Comprehensive Analysis
    
    Abstract:
    This study examines the relationship between climate change and renewable energy adoption globally. 
    Our research indicates that solar energy capacity has grown by 260% over the past decade, making it 
    the fastest-growing energy source worldwide. Wind power now accounts for approximately 24% of renewable 
    electricity generation in OECD countries.
    
    Introduction:
    Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century. The 
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that global mean temperatures have increased 
    by 1.1¬∞C since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900). Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have 
    reached 415 parts per million, the highest level in over 3 million years.
    
    Methodology:
    We analyzed data from 195 countries over a 15-year period (2008-2023). Our dataset includes energy 
    production statistics, carbon emission measurements, and economic indicators. The study employed 
    machine learning algorithms to identify correlations between renewable energy investments and 
    emission reductions.
    
    Results:
    Our analysis reveals several key findings:
    
    1. Countries that increased their renewable energy share by more than 50% showed a corresponding 
       35% reduction in carbon intensity over the study period.
    
    2. Solar photovoltaic costs have decreased by 89% since 2010, making it cost-competitive with 
       fossil fuels in 140+ countries.
    
    3. Electric vehicle sales surged to 10.5 million units globally in 2022, representing a 55% 
       increase from the previous year.
    
    4. Offshore wind capacity expanded by 8.8 GW in 2022, bringing total global capacity to 57 GW.
    
    5. Green hydrogen production is projected to reach 24 million tons annually by 2030, up from 
       current levels of less than 1 million tons.
    
    Discussion:
    The data demonstrates a strong correlation between renewable energy deployment and carbon emission 
    reductions. Countries like Denmark generate 80% of their electricity from renewable sources, 
    primarily wind power. Norway produces 98% of its electricity from renewable sources, mainly 
    hydroelectric power.
    
    The economic benefits are equally compelling. The renewable energy sector employed 13.7 million 
    people worldwide in 2022, an increase of 1 million jobs from the previous year. Investment in 
    renewable energy reached $1.8 trillion globally in 2022.
    
    Conclusion:
    The transition to renewable energy is both environmentally necessary and economically viable. 
    To limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement, 
    renewable energy must comprise 90% of the global energy mix by 2050. Current trends suggest this 
    target is achievable with sustained policy support and continued technological innovation.

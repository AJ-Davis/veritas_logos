# Security Audit Checklist for Veritas Logos API Gateway

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Veritas Logos API Gateway and provides a comprehensive checklist for security auditing.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Implementation
- [x] JWT tokens use strong secret keys (256-bit minimum)
- [x] Token expiration is enforced (24 hours default)
- [x] Refresh token mechanism implemented
- [x] Token validation on every protected endpoint
- [x] Proper error handling for invalid/expired tokens

#### User Management
- [x] Password hashing using bcrypt with salt
- [x] User roles and permissions system
- [x] Admin-only endpoints properly protected
- [x] Account lockout after failed login attempts
- [x] Password complexity requirements

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Request Validation
- [x] Input length limits enforced
- [x] SQL injection prevention
- [x] XSS attack prevention
- [x] Path traversal protection
- [x] File upload validation (type, size, content)

#### Data Sanitization
- [x] String sanitization for dangerous characters
- [x] Email format validation
- [x] UUID format validation
- [x] Recursive data structure sanitization

### 3. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

#### API Rate Limiting
- [x] General API endpoints: 10 requests/second
- [x] Authentication endpoints: 5 requests/second
- [x] File upload endpoints: Lower limits
- [x] IP-based rate limiting
- [x] Burst allowance configuration

#### Protection Mechanisms
- [x] SlowAPI middleware for rate limiting
- [x] Request size limits (50MB for uploads)
- [x] Connection timeout configuration
- [x] Nginx rate limiting at proxy level

### 4. HTTPS & Transport Security

#### SSL/TLS Configuration
- [ ] SSL certificates properly configured
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ enforcement
- [ ] Strong cipher suites only
- [ ] HSTS headers enabled
- [ ] Certificate pinning (recommended for production)

#### Security Headers
- [x] X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security header

### 5. CORS Configuration

#### Cross-Origin Policy
- [x] Specific origin whitelist (no wildcards in production)
- [x] Credentials allowed only for trusted origins
- [x] Method restrictions enforced
- [x] Header restrictions enforced

### 6. Database Security

#### SQLite Security
- [x] Database file permissions restricted
- [x] SQL injection prevention through ORM
- [x] Backup encryption (recommended)
- [x] Database connection security

### 7. Container Security

#### Docker Configuration
- [x] Non-root user for application
- [x] Minimal base image (python:3.9-slim)
- [x] Multi-stage build for smaller attack surface
- [x] Health checks implemented
- [x] Resource limits configured

#### Secrets Management
- [x] Environment variables for secrets
- [x] No secrets in image layers
- [x] Secret rotation capability
- [x] Secure secret generation

### 8. Logging & Monitoring

#### Security Logging
- [x] Authentication attempts logged
- [x] Failed requests logged
- [x] Rate limit violations logged
- [x] Suspicious activity detection
- [x] Request ID tracing

#### Monitoring
- [x] Real-time metrics collection
- [x] Performance monitoring
- [x] Error rate monitoring
- [x] Security event alerting (basic)

## Security Testing Checklist

### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Test with invalid tokens
- [ ] Test with expired tokens
- [ ] Test token manipulation attempts
- [ ] Test password brute force protection
- [ ] Test privilege escalation attempts

### Input Validation Testing
- [ ] SQL injection attempts
- [ ] XSS payload injection
- [ ] Path traversal attempts
- [ ] File upload bypass attempts
- [ ] Large payload attacks

### Rate Limiting Testing
- [ ] Verify rate limits are enforced
- [ ] Test burst handling
- [ ] Test distributed rate limit bypass
- [ ] Test rate limit error responses

### CORS Testing
- [ ] Test unauthorized origins
- [ ] Test preflight request handling
- [ ] Test credential handling
- [ ] Test method restrictions

### Infrastructure Testing
- [ ] Port scanning
- [ ] Service enumeration
- [ ] Container escape attempts
- [ ] Network segmentation testing

## Vulnerability Management

### Regular Security Tasks

#### Daily
- [ ] Monitor security logs
- [ ] Check for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Review rate limiting violations

#### Weekly
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] Docker image security scan
- [ ] Log analysis review

#### Monthly
- [ ] Security configuration review
- [ ] Access control audit
- [ ] Certificate expiration check

#### Quarterly
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security policy review
- [ ] Incident response plan testing

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Configure proper SSL certificates for production
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. Set up automated security scanning
4. Create incident response procedures

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
1. Implement API key authentication for service-to-service calls
2. Add request signing for critical operations
3. Implement comprehensive audit logging
4. Set up SIEM integration

### Long Term (Lower Priority)
1. Implement OAuth2/OpenID Connect
2. Add multi-factor authentication
3. Implement zero-trust networking
4. Add advanced threat detection

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- [ ] GDPR compliance for EU users
- [ ] Data minimization principles
- [ ] Right to deletion implementation
- [ ] Data breach notification procedures

### Industry Standards
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 mitigation
- [ ] ISO 27001 alignment
- [ ] SOC 2 Type II compliance
- [ ] Payment Card Industry (PCI) DSS if applicable

## Incident Response

### Preparation
- [ ] Incident response team identified
- [ ] Communication plan established
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Security contact information updated

### Detection & Analysis
